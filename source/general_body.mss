@begin(Discussion)
The idea of the Specialized Needs Annexes is that implementations
can choose to target certain application areas.
For example, an implementation specifically targeted to embedded
machines might support the application-specific features for
Real-time Systems, but not the application-specific features
for Information Systems.

The Specialized Needs Annexes extend the core language only in ways that
users, implementations, and standards bodies are allowed to extend the
language;
for example, via additional library units,
attributes, representation items (see @RefSecNum{Operational and Representation Aspects}),
@nt{pragma}s,
and constraints on semantic details that are left unspecified by the
core language.
Many implementations already provide much of the functionality defined
by Specialized Needs Annexes;
our goal is to increase uniformity among implementations by defining
standard ways of providing the functionality.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}@ChgNote{Make consistent with 18009}
We recommend that the @Chg{Version=[2],New=[certification],Old=[validation]}
procedures allow implementations to
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[certify],Old=[validate]} the core language, plus any
set of the Specialized Needs Annexes. We recommend that
implementations @i{not} be allowed to @Chg{Version=[2],New=[certify],Old=[validate]}
a portion of one of the Specialized Needs Annexes,
although implementations can, of course, provide @Chg{Version=[2],
New=[uncertified],Old=[unvalidated]} support for such
portions. We have designed the Specialized Needs Annexes assuming that
this recommendation is followed. Thus, our decisions about what to
include and what not to include in those annexes are
based on the assumption that each
annex is @Chg{Version=[2],New=[certified],Old=[validated]} in an
@lquotes@;all-or-nothing@rquotes@; manner.

An implementation may, of course,
support extensions that are different from
(but possibly related to)
those defined by one of the Specialized Needs Annexes.
We recommend that, where appropriate, implementations do this by adding
library units that are children of existing language-defined library
packages.

An implementation should not provide extensions that conflict with
those defined in the Specialized Needs Annexes, in the following sense:
Suppose an
implementation supports a certain error-free program that uses only
functionality defined in the core and in the Specialized Needs Annexes.
The implementation should ensure that that program will still be error
free in some possible full implementation of all of the Specialized Needs
Annexes, and that the semantics of the program will not change.
For example, an implementation should not provide a package
with the same name as one defined in one of the Specialized Needs Annexes,
but that behaves
differently, @i{even if that implementation does not claim
conformance to that Annex}.

Note that the Specialized Needs Annexes do not conflict with each
other; it is the intent that a single implementation can conform
to all of them.

After the introductory text, text is labeled with the following headings:
@end{WideAbove}
@end{Intro}

@begin{MetaRules}
These are not rules of the language, but guiding principles or goals used in
defining the rules of the language.
In some cases, the goal is only partially met;
such cases are explained.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised]}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0005-1]}
This is not part of the definition of the language,
and does not appear in the @Chg{Version=[2],New=[Ada
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[@Chg{Version=[5],New=[2022],Old=[2012]}],Old=[2005]} RM],Old=[RM95]}.
@end{MetaRules}

@begin{Syntax}
@begin{SyntaxText}
@Defn2{Term=[syntax], Sec=(under Syntax heading)}
@Defn2{Term=[grammar], Sec=(under Syntax heading)}
@Defn2{Term=[context free grammar], Sec=(under Syntax heading)}
@Defn2{Term=[BNF (Backus-Naur Form)], Sec=(under Syntax heading)}
@Defn2{Term=[Backus-Naur Form (BNF)], Sec=(under Syntax heading)}
Syntax rules (indented).
@end{SyntaxText}
@end{Syntax}

@begin{Resolution}
@Chgref{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
@Defn{name resolution rules}
@Defn{overloading rules}
@Defn{resolution rules}
Compile-time rules that are used in name resolution,
including overload resolution.
@begin{Discussion}
These rules are observed at compile time.
(We say @lquotes@;observed@rquotes rather than @lquotes@;checked@rquotes,
because these rules are not individually checked.
They are really just part of the @LegalityName@;s in @Chg{Version=[3],New=[Clause],Old=[Section]}
@RefSecNum{Visibility Rules} that require exactly one interpretation of each
constituent of a complete context.) The only rules used in overload resolution
are the @SyntaxName@;s and the @ResolutionName@;s.

When dealing with nonoverloadable declarations it sometimes makes no
semantic difference whether a given rule is a @ResolutionName
or a @LegalityName,
and it is sometimes difficult to decide which it should be.
We generally make a given rule a @ResolutionName only if it has to be.
For example,
@lquotes@;The @nt{name}, if any, in a @nt{raise_statement} shall be the @nt{name}
of an exception.@rquotes@;
is under @lquotes@;@LegalityTitle.@rquotes@;
@end{Discussion}
@end{Resolution}

@begin{Legality}
@Defn{legality rules}
@Defn{compile-time error}
@Defn2{Term=[error], Sec=(compile-time)}
Rules that are enforced at compile time.
@Defn2{Term=[legal], Sec=(construct)}
@Defn2{Term=[illegal], Sec=(construct)}
A construct is @i{legal} if it obeys all of the @LegalityName@;s.
@begin{Discussion}
These rules are not used in overload resolution.

Note that run-time errors are always attached to exceptions;
for example, it is not @lquotes@;illegal@rquotes@; to divide by zero,
it just raises an exception.
@end{Discussion}
@end{Legality}

@begin{StaticSem}
@Defn{static semantics}
@Defn{compile-time semantics}
A definition of the compile-time effect of each construct.
@begin{Discussion}
The most important compile-time effects represent the effects
on the symbol table associated with declarations (implicit or
explicit). In addition, we use this heading as a bit of a grab
bag for equivalences, package specifications, etc.
For example, this is where we put statements like so-and-so is
equivalent to such-and-such. (We ought to try to really mean it when we say
such things!)
Similarly, statements about magically-generated implicit declarations
go here.
These rules are generally written as statements of fact about the
semantics, rather than as a you-shall-do-such-and-such sort of thing.
@end{Discussion}
@end{StaticSem}

@begin{LinkTime}
@Defn{post-compilation error}
@Defn{post-compilation rules}
@IndexSee{Term=[link-time error],See=(post-compilation error)}
@Defn2{Term=[error], Sec=(link-time)}
Rules that are enforced before running a partition.
@Defn2{Term=[legal], Sec=(partition)}
@Defn2{Term=[illegal], Sec=(partition)}
A partition is legal if its compilation units are legal
and it obeys all of the @LinkTimeName@;s.
@begin{Discussion}
It is not specified exactly when these rules are checked, so
long as they are checked for any given partition before that partition starts
running. An implementation may choose to check some such rules at compile
time, and reject @nt{compilation_unit}s accordingly.
Alternatively, an implementation may check such rules when the partition is
created (usually known as @lquotes@;link time@rquotes@;),
or when the partition is mapped to a particular piece of hardware (but before
the partition starts running).
@end{Discussion}
@end{LinkTime}

@begin{RunTime}
@Defn{dynamic semantics}
@Defn{run-time semantics}
@Defn{run-time error}
@Defn2{Term=[error], Sec=(run-time)}
A definition of the run-time effect of each construct.
@begin{Discussion}
This heading describes what happens at run time.
runtime checks,
which raise exceptions upon failure,
are described here.
Each item that involves a runtime check is marked with the name
of the check @em these are the same check names that are used in a
@nt{pragma} Suppress.
Principle: Every check should have a name,
usable in a @nt{pragma} Suppress.
@end{Discussion}
@end{RunTime}

@begin{Bounded}
@Defn{bounded error}
@SeeAlso{Primary=[error], Other=(bounded error)}
Situations that result in bounded (run-time) errors
(see @RefSecNum{Classification of Errors}).
@begin{Discussion}
The @lquotes@;bounds@rquotes@; of each such error are described here @em
that is, we characterize the set of all possible behaviors that can
result from a bounded error occurring at run time.
@end{Discussion}
@end{Bounded}

@begin{Erron}
@Defn{erroneous execution}
@SeeAlso{Primary=[error], Other=(erroneous execution)}
Situations that result in erroneous execution
(see @RefSecNum{Classification of Errors}).
@end{Erron}

@begin{ImplReq}
@Defn{implementation requirements}
Additional requirements for conforming implementations.
@begin{Discussion}
...as opposed to rules imposed on the programmer.
An example might be,
@lquotes@;The smallest representable duration, Duration'Small,
shall not be greater than twenty milliseconds@rquotes.

It's really just an issue of how the rule is worded.
We could write the same rule as @lquotes@;The smallest representable duration is
an implementation-defined value less than or equal to 20 milliseconds@rquotes
and then it would be under @lquotes@;@StaticSemTitle@rquotes.
@end{Discussion}
@end{ImplReq}

@begin{DocReq}
@Defn{documentation requirements}
Documentation requirements for conforming implementations.
@begin{Discussion}
These requirements are beyond those that are implicitly specified by
the phrase @lquotes@;implementation defined@rquotes@;. The
latter require documentation as well, but we don't repeat these cases
under this heading. Usually this heading is used for when the
description of the documentation requirement is longer and does not
correspond directly to one, narrow normative sentence.
@end{Discussion}
@end{DocReq}

@begin{Metrics}
@Defn{metrics}
Metrics that are specified for the time/space properties of the execution
of certain language constructs.
@end{Metrics}

@begin{ImplPerm}
@Defn{implementation permissions}
Additional permissions given to the implementer.
@begin{Discussion}
For example, @lquotes@;The implementation is allowed to impose further
restrictions on the record aggregates allowed in code statements.@rquotes
When there are restrictions on the permission,
those restrictions are given here also.
For example, @lquotes@;An implementation is allowed to restrict the kinds of
subprograms that are allowed to be main subprograms.
However, it shall support at least parameterless procedures.@rquotes
@em we don't split this up between here and @lquotes@ImplReqTitle@rquotes.
@end{Discussion}
@end{ImplPerm}

@begin{ImplAdvice}
@Defn{implementation advice}
@Defn{advice}
Optional advice given to the implementer.
The word @lquotes@;should@rquotes@; is used to indicate that the advice is
a recommendation, not a requirement.
It is implementation defined
whether or not a given recommendation is obeyed.
@ChgImplDef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],InitialVersion=[0],
Text=[Whether or not each recommendation
given in @ImplAdviceTitle is followed@Chg{Version=[2],
New=[ @em see @RefSec{Implementation Advice} for a listing],Old=[]}.]}
@begin{Discussion}
@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised]}
The advice generally shows the intended implementation, but
the implementer is free to ignore it.
The implementer is the sole arbiter of whether or not the advice has
been obeyed, if not, whether the reason is a good one,
and whether the required documentation is sufficient.
@Chg{Version=[1],New=[],Old=[@PDefn2{Term=[ACVC],Sec=(Ada Compiler Validation Capability)}
@PDefn2{Term=[Ada Compiler Validation Capability],Sec=(ACVC)}]}
It would be wrong for the @Chg{Version=[1],New=[ACATS],Old=[ACVC]} to enforce any of
this advice.

For example,
@lquotes@;Whenever possible, the implementation should choose a value no
greater than fifty microseconds for the smallest representable duration,
Duration'Small.@rquotes

We use this heading, for example, when the rule is so low level or
implementation-oriented as to be untestable.
We also use this heading when we wish to encourage implementations
to behave in a certain way in most cases, but we do not wish to
burden implementations by requiring the behavior.
@end{Discussion}
@end{ImplAdvice}

@begin{Notes}
@Defn{notes}
Notes emphasize consequences of the rules
described in the (sub)clause or elsewhere.
This material is informative.
@end{Notes}

@begin{Examples}
Examples illustrate the possible forms of the constructs described.
This material is informative.
@begin{Discussion}
@ChgRef{Version=[5],Kind=[Added],ARef=[AI12-0386-1]}
@ChgAdded{Version=[5],Text=[Names used in examples refer either to 
language-defined entities or to entities declared in other @ExamplesTitle in 
this @StdTitle. In the latter case, if the reference is to a later example, we
use a cross-reference (@ExamCom{-- See <<some clause>>.}) to show the source
of the declaration. In theory, one could combine all of the examples (excepting
examples of fragments like identifiers or @nt{type_definition}s) in an
appropriate unit and compile them all.]}

The next three headings list all language changes between Ada 83
and Ada 95. Language changes are any change that changes the set of
text strings that are legal Ada programs, or changes the meaning of
any legal program.
Wording changes, such as changes in terminology, are not language
changes.
Each language change falls into one of the following three
categories:
@end{Discussion}
@end{Examples}

@begin{Inconsistent83}
@Defn{inconsistencies with Ada 83}
This heading lists all of the upward inconsistencies between Ada 83 and Ada
95. Upward inconsistencies are situations in which a legal Ada 83 program
is a legal Ada 95 program with different semantics.
This type of upward incompatibility is the worst type for users,
so we only tolerate it in rare situations.

(Note that the semantics of a program is not the same thing as the
behavior of the program.
Because of Ada's indeterminacy,
the @lquotes@;semantics@rquotes@; of a given feature describes a @i{set} of behaviors
that can be exhibited by that feature.
The set can contain more than one allowed behavior.
Thus, when we ask whether the semantics changes,
we are asking whether the set of behaviors changes.)

       The way in which errors or capacity problems are reported is not

       except where such permission is explicitly granted,
       unless such modifications are semantically neutral with respect
       to the client compilation units of the library unit.
       An implementation defines the contents of the private part and
       body of language-defined library units.

       An implementation can add @nt{with_clause}s and @nt{use_clause}s,
       since these modifications are semantically neutral to clients.
       (The implementation might need @nt{with_clause}s in order to
       implement the private part, for example.)
       Similarly, an implementation can add a private part even in cases
       where a private part is not shown in the @StdTitle.
       Explicit declarations can be provided implicitly or by renaming,
       provided the changes are semantically neutral.

       @Defn2{Term=[italics],Sec=(implementation-defined)}
       Wherever in the @StdTitle the text of a language-defined library
       unit contains an italicized phrase starting with

       will replace that phrase with some implementation-defined text
       that is syntactically legal at that place, and follows any other
       applicable rules.

       Note that modifications are permitted, even if there are other tools
       in the environment that can detect the changes (such as a program
       library browser), so long as the modifications make no difference

     @begin{Reason}
     The @lquotes@;impossible or impractical@rquotes@; wording comes from AI-325.
     It takes some judgement and common sense to interpret this.
     Restricting compilation units to less than 4 lines is probably
     unreasonable, whereas restricting them to less than 4 billion lines
     is probably reasonable (at least given today's technology).
     We do not know exactly where to draw the line,

@end{WideAbove}
@begin{Ramification}
  There is no need to produce any of the @lquotes@;internal effects@rquotes@;
  defined for the semantics of the program @em all of these
  can be optimized away @em so long as an appropriate sequence
  of external interactions is produced.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{Discussion}
  See also @RefSecNum(Exceptions and Optimization) which specifies
  various liberties associated with optimizations in
  the presence of language-defined checks,
  that could change the external effects that
  might be produced. These alternative external effects
  are still consistent with the standard, since
  @RefSecNum(Exceptions and Optimization) is part of the standard.

  Note also that we only require @lquotes@i(an appropriate) sequence
  of external interactions@rquotes rather than @lquotes@;@i(the same) sequence...@rquotes
  An optimizer may cause a different sequence of external interactions
  to be produced than would be produced without the optimizer, so
  long as the new sequence still satisfies the requirements
  of the standard. For example, optimization might affect
  the relative rate of progress of two concurrent tasks, thereby
  altering the order in which two external interactions occur.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised]}
  Note that @Chg{Version=[2],New=[the Ada 83 RM],Old=[RM83]} explicitly
  mentions the case of an @lquotes@;exact effect@rquotes@;
  of a program, but since so few programs have their effects defined
  that exactly,
  we don't even mention this @lquotes@;special@rquotes@; case. In particular,
  almost any program that uses floating point or tasking has to have
  some level
  of inexactness in the specification of its effects. And if one
  includes aspects of the timing of the external interactions
  in the external effect of the program (as is appropriate for a real-time
  language), no @lquotes@;exact effect@rquotes@; can be specified.
  For example, if two external interactions initiated by a single task
  are separated by a @lquotes@;@key(delay) 1.0;@rquotes@; then the language rules
  imply that the two external interactions have to be separated in time
  by at least one second, as defined by the clock associated with
  the @nt<delay_relative_statement>. This in turn implies that
  the time at which an external interaction occurs is part of
  the characterization of the external interaction, at least in
  some cases, again making the specification of the required
  @lquotes@;exact effect@rquotes@; impractical.

An implementation that conforms to this @StdTitle shall support each
capability required by the core language as specified.
In addition,
an implementation that conforms to this @StdTitle may conform to one
or more Specialized Needs Annexes (or to none).
Conformance to a Specialized Needs Annex means that each capability
required by the Annex @Chg{Version=[5],New=[shall be],Old=[is]} provided as
specified.
@begin{Discussion}
  The last sentence defines what it means to say that an
  implementation conforms to a Specialized Needs Annex, namely, only
  by supporting all capabilities required by the Annex.
@end{Discussion}

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0229-1]}
An implementation conforming to this @IntlStdTitle may provide additional
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[aspects, ],Old=[]}attributes, library units, and pragmas.
However, it shall not provide any
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[aspect, ],Old=[]}attribute,
library unit, or pragma having the same name
as an @Chg{Version=[3],New=[aspect, ],Old=[]}attribute, library unit,
or pragma (respectively)
specified in a Specialized Needs Annex unless the provided construct
is either as specified in the Specialized Needs Annex or is more
limited in capability than that required by the Annex.
A program that attempts to use an unsupported capability of an Annex
shall either be identified by the implementation before run time or
shall raise an exception at run time.
@begin{Discussion}
  The last sentence of the preceding paragraph defines what an
  implementation is allowed to do when it does not "conform" to a
  Specialized Needs Annex.
  In particular, the sentence forbids implementations from providing
  a construct with the same name as a corresponding construct in a
  Specialized Needs Annex but with a different syntax
  (e.g., an extended syntax) or quite different semantics.
  The phrase concerning "more limited in capability" is intended to
  give permission to provide a partial implementation, such as not
  implementing a subprogram in a package or having a restriction not
  permitted by an implementation that conforms to the Annex.
  For example, a partial implementation of the package Ada.Decimal
  might have Decimal.Max_Decimal_Digits as 15 (rather than the
  required 18).
  This allows a partial implementation to grow to a fully conforming
  implementation.

  A restricted implementation might be restricted by not providing
  some subprograms specified in one of the packages defined by an
  Annex.
  In this case, a program that tries to use the missing subprogram
  will usually fail to compile.
  Alternatively, the implementation might declare the subprogram as
  abstract, so it cannot be called.
  Alternatively, a subprogram body might be implemented just to raise
  Program_Error.
  The advantage of this approach is that a program to be run under a
  fully conforming Annex implementation can be checked syntactically
  and semantically under an implementation that only partially
  supports the Annex.
  Finally, an implementation might provide a package declaration
  without the corresponding body, so that programs can be compiled,
  but partitions cannot be built and executed.

  To ensure against wrong answers being delivered by a partial
  implementation, implementers are required to raise an exception
  when a program attempts to use an unsupported capability and this
  can be detected only at run time.
  For example, a partial implementation of Ada.Decimal might require
  the length of the Currency string to be 1, and hence, an
  exception would be raised if a subprogram were called in the
  package Edited_Output with a length greater than 1.

@begin{Discussion}
  We used to use the term @lquotes@;implementation dependent@rquotes

  However, that sounded too much like @lquotes@;implementation defined@rquotes.
  Furthermore, the term @lquotes@;unspecified@rquotes is used in the ANSI C and

  We also use @lquotes@;not specified@rquotes and @lquotes@;not specified by the language@rquotes@;

@end{Discussion}

The implementation may choose to document implementation-defined behavior
either by documenting what happens in general,
or by providing some mechanism for the user to determine what
happens in a particular case.
@begin(Discussion)
For example, if the @StdTitle says that library unit elaboration order
is implementation defined,
the implementation might describe (in its user's manual)
the algorithm it uses to determine the elaboration order.
On the other hand, the implementation might provide a
command that produces
a description of the elaboration order for a partition upon request
from the user.
It is also acceptable to provide cross references to existing
documentation (for example, a hardware manual), where appropriate.

Note that dependence of a program on implementation-defined or
unspecified functionality is not defined to be an error;
it might cause the program to be less portable, however.

The reason we don't @i{require} Program_Error is that there are
situations where other exceptions might make sense.
For example, if the Real Time Systems Annex requires
that the range of System.Priority include at least 30 values,
an implementation could conform to the @StdTitle (but not to the Annex)
if it supported only 12 values.
Since the rules of the language require Constraint_Error to be raised
for out-of-range values,
we cannot require Program_Error to be raised instead.
@end{Reason}

If an implementation wishes to provide implementation-defined
extensions to the functionality of a language-defined library unit,
it should normally do so by adding children to the library unit.

If an implementation has support code

@LabeledSubclause{Method of Description and Syntax Notation}

@begin{Intro}
The form of an Ada program is described by means of a context-free
syntax together with context-dependent requirements expressed by
narrative rules.

The meaning of Ada programs is described by means of narrative
rules defining both the effects of each construct and the composition
rules for constructs.

@Defn2{Term=[BNF (Backus-Naur Form)], Sec=(notation)}
@Defn2{Term=[Backus-Naur Form (BNF)], Sec=(notation)}
The context-free syntax of the language is described using a simple variant
of Backus-Naur Form. In particular:
@begin(Itemize)
@leading@keepnext@;Lower case words in a sans-serif font,
some containing embedded underlines, are used to
denote syntactic categories, for example:
@begin(Display)
@nt<case_statement>
@end(Display)

@leading@keepnext@;Boldface words are used to denote reserved words,
for example:
@begin(Display)
@key(array)
@end(Display)

@leading@keepnext@;Square brackets enclose optional items. Thus the two
following rules are equivalent.
@begin(Display)
@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00433-01]}@Chg{Version=[2],New=[@nt<simple_return_statement>],Old=[@nt<return_statement>]} ::= @key(return) [@nt<expression>];
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[@nt<simple_return_statement>],Old=[@nt<return_statement>]} ::= @key(return); | @key(return) @nt<expression>;
@end(Display)

@leading@keepnext@;Curly brackets enclose a repeated item. The item may
appear zero or more times; the repetitions occur from left to right as with an
equivalent left-recursive rule. Thus the two following rules are
equivalent.
@begin(Display)
@nt<term> ::= @nt<factor> {@nt<multiplying_operator> @nt<factor>}
@nt<term> ::= @nt<factor> | @nt<term> @nt<multiplying_operator> @nt<factor>

@Defn2{Term=[italics],Sec=(syntax rules)}
If the name of any syntactic category starts with an italicized
part, it is equivalent to the category name without the italicized
part. The italicized part is intended to convey some semantic
information. For example @i(subtype_)@nt<name> and
@i(task_)@nt<name> are both equivalent to @nt<name> alone.
@end(Itemize)
@begin(Discussion)
@Defn{LR(1)}
@Defn{ambiguous grammar}
@Defn2{Term=[grammar],Sec=(resolution of ambiguity)}
@Defn2{Term=[grammar],Sec=(ambiguous)}
The grammar given in @Chg{Version=[2],New=[this @IntlStdName],
old=[the RM95]} is not LR(1).
In fact, it is ambiguous; the ambiguities are resolved
by the overload resolution rules
(see @RefSecNum{The Context of Overload Resolution}).

We often use @lquotes@;if@rquotes to mean @lquotes@;if and only if@rquotes in definitions.
For example, if we define @lquotes@;photogenic@rquotes by saying,
@lquotes@;A type is photogenic if it has the following properties...@rquotes,
we mean that a type is photogenic if @i{and only if}
it has those properties.
It is usually clear from the context,
and adding the @lquotes@;and only if@rquotes seems too cumbersome.

When we say, for example, @lquotes@;a @nt{declarative_item} of a
@nt{declarative_part}@rquotes, we are talking about a @nt{declarative_item}
immediately within that @nt{declarative_part}. When we say @lquotes@;a
@nt{declarative_item} in, or within, a @nt{declarative_part}@rquotes@;, we are
talking about a @nt{declarative_item} anywhere in the
@nt{declarative_part}, possibly deeply nested within other
@nt{declarative_part}s. (This notation doesn't work very well for
@nt{name}s, since the name @lquotes@;of@rquotes@; something also has another meaning.)

When we refer to the name of a language-defined
entity (for example, Duration),
we mean the language-defined entity even in programs where the declaration
of the language-defined entity is hidden by another declaration.
For example, when we say that the expected type for the @nt<expression>
of a @nt<delay_relative_statement> is Duration, we mean the language-defined
type Duration that is declared in Standard, not some type
Duration the user might have declared.

There is no requirement that the implementation always choose

incrementing some global and returning the result,
a call such as P(F, F) is OK if the programmer cares only
that the two results of F are unique;
the two calls of F cannot be executed in parallel,
unless the compiler can prove that parallel execution is
equivalent to some sequential order.

     @Defn{bounded error}
     The errors of this category are called @i{bounded errors}.

     @NoPrefix@ChgRef{Version=[5],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI12-0444-1]}@Defn{erroneous execution}
     In addition to bounded errors, the language rules define certain
     kinds of errors as leading to @i{erroneous execution}. Like bounded
     errors, the implementation @Chg{Version=[5],New=[is not expected
     to],Old=[need not]} detect such errors either prior
     to or during run time. Unlike bounded errors, there is no
     language-specified bound on the possible effect of erroneous
     execution; the effect is in general not predictable.
     @begin{Ramification}
       Executions are erroneous, not programs or parts of programs.
       Once something erroneous happens, the execution of the entire program
       is erroneous from that point on, and potentially before given
       possible reorderings permitted by
       @RefSecNum(Exceptions and Optimization) and elsewhere.
       We cannot limit it to just one partition,
       since partitions are not required to live in separate address spaces.
       (But implementations are encouraged to limit it as much as possible.)

       Suppose a program contains a pair of things that will be executed @lquotes@;in
       an arbitrary order@rquotes.
       It is possible that one order will result in something sensible, whereas
       the other order will result in erroneous execution.
       If the implementation happens to choose the first order,
       then the execution is not erroneous.
       This may seem odd, but it is not harmful.

       Saying that something is erroneous is semantically
       equivalent to saying that the behavior is unspecified.
       However, @lquotes@;erroneous@rquotes has a slightly more disapproving
       flavor.

@Redundant[@Defn2{Term={mode of operation}, Sec=(nonstandard)}
@Defn{nonstandard mode}An implementation may provide
@i(nonstandard modes) of operation.
Typically these modes would be selected by a @nt<pragma> or by a command line
switch when the compiler is invoked. When operating in
a nonstandard mode, the implementation may reject @nt<compilation_unit>s
that do not conform to additional requirements associated
with the mode, such as an excessive number of warnings or violation
of coding style guidelines. Similarly, in a nonstandard mode,
the implementation may apply special optimizations or alternative
algorithms that are only meaningful for programs that
satisfy certain criteria specified by the implementation.
@Defn2{Term={mode of operation}, Sec=(standard)}
@Defn{standard mode}
In any case, an implementation shall support a @i(standard) mode that
conforms to the requirements of this @IntlStdTitle; in particular, in the standard
mode, all legal @nt<compilation_unit>s shall be accepted.]
@begin{Discussion}
  These permissions are designed to authorize explicitly the
  support for alternative modes. Of course, nothing we say can
  prevent them anyway, but this (redundant) paragraph is designed
  to indicate that such alternative modes are in some sense @lquotes@;approved@rquotes@;
  and even encouraged where they serve the specialized needs of
  a given user community, so long as the standard mode, designed
  to foster maximum portability, is always available.

@begin{ImplAdvice}
If an implementation detects a bounded error or erroneous execution,
it should raise Program_Error.

@begin{DiffWord83}
Some situations that are erroneous in Ada 83 are no longer errors
at all.
For example, depending on the parameter passing mechanism when
unspecified is possibly nonportable, but not erroneous.

Other situations that are erroneous in Ada 83 are changed
to be bounded errors.
In particular, evaluating an uninitialized scalar variable is
a bounded error.
The possible results are to raise Program_Error (as always), or to
produce a machine-representable value (which might not be in the
subtype of the variable).
Violating a Range_Check or Overflow_Check raises
Constraint_Error, even if the value came from an uninitialized
variable.
This means that optimizers can no longer
@lquotes@;assume@rquotes@; that all variables are initialized within their subtype's
range.
Violating a check that is suppressed remains erroneous.

The @lquotes@;incorrect order dependences@rquotes@; category of errors is removed.
All such situations are simply considered potential nonportabilities.
This category was removed due to the difficulty of defining
what it means for two executions to have a @lquotes@;different effect@rquotes.
For example, if a function with a side effect is called twice in a single
expression, it is not in principle possible for the compiler to
decide whether the correctness of the resulting program depends on the order
of execution of the two function calls. A compile time warning
might be appropriate, but raising of Program_Error at
run time would not be.
