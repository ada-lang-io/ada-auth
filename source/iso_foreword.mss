@begin{ISOOnly}@Comment{This is ISO boilerplate for 2022, we don't want it in the RM}
@Comment{Note: We have made no attempt to correlate this to any previous
ISO boilerplate - it's fairly different. For ISO versions 0 through 4,
use the Foreword found in the original Front_Matter.Mss.}

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization)
and IEC (the International Electrotechnical Commission)
form the specialized system for worldwide standardization.
National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC
participate in the development of International Standards through
technical committees established by the respective organization to deal
with particular fields of technical activity.
ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate in fields of mutual
interest. Other international organizations, governmental and non-governmental,
in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work.

The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further
maintenance are described in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 1. In particular, the
different approval criteria needed for the different types of document should
be noted. This document was drafted in accordance with the editorial rules of
the ISO/IEC Directives, Part@ 2 (see @Urllink{URL=[https://www.iso.org/directives],

This fourth edition cancels
and replaces the third edition (ISO/IEC 8652:2012), which has been technically
revised. It also incorporates the Technical Corrigendum ISO/IEC 8652:2012/Cor.1:2016.
